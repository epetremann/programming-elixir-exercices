Exercise: WorkingWithMultipleProcesses-3

Use spawn_link to start a process, and have that process send a message to the
parent and then exit immediately.
Meanwhile, sleep for 500 ms in the parent, then receive as many messages as are
waiting. Trace what you receive.
Does it matter that you werenâ€™t waiting for the notification from the child when it exited?
